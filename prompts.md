- Introduce
- {Rust game} Not about game, about language
- {Rust logo} Joking aren't there enough languages, yes there are {Megamind}, rust is cumination
- Back up big claim with big claims {Rust site}
- "Rust is blazingly fast with no runtime or garbage collector and it guarantees memory and thread safety" {Sweet jesus}
- They aren't kidding, stands up to every word.
- Staring down a cpp bug, talking to your {rubber duck} as if it's your therapist, and, you know, all around having an existential crisis.
- I'm sure we've all been there
- The way rust works means that you don't have to deal with **that** type of problem again. {compiler no}
- Compiler literally does not let you make mistakes like that.
- "Rust uses lifetimes and borrowing to ensure all memory that your monkey brain thinks exists, actually does"
- Lifetimes ensure any references you create become invalid once you destroy the original data.
- Borrowing allows the tracking of data ownership.
- Best part, does at compile time. Runtime fast
- Caveats: {slow compiler}, small things {chaplin} in place of your ignorance
- If you ask me and the people who voted rust {stackoverflow} the most loved lang every year since 2016, that is a small price to pay.
- Essentially Rust takes C++, removes outdated crap, slaps on sexy syntax.
- Your favourite parts of CPP and haskell together in a modern, easy to use package.
- Regardless of all that jargon, you should use rust because of {ferris}.
- Ferris is a badass, don't let that demeanour fool you.
- {Comparison} prime calculator, eratosthenes. Comparable as possible, but no god. Github, how stupid I am.
- Rust is 24% faster running consistently at 39,504 nanoseconds.
- CPP **best case** 49,193 nanoseconds.
- Shitty time code
- Rust functional, haskell good. When procedural and functional integrated, practically swoon.
- I could keep listing things but I'll let you be the final judge;
- {zoot ferris}
- I can't force you to use, but hope inspired to use rust next project
- Badass ferris and I thank you for listening
