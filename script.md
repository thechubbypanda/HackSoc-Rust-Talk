{Slide - Hype train}

Evening everyone, my name is Keval and I'm here to tell you why you should try Rust.

{Slide - Funny Rust game screenshot} And no, I'm not talking about the game that I'm sure we all know and love, I'm talking about the programming language.

{Slide - Rust crab with zoot and shades}

Now, you may be thinking: "What? Another programming language? Aren't there enough of those already?", and to that I'll say: Yes, yes there are... 

{Slide - Megamind}

but Rust is the culmination of all of them.

Ok, ok. Time to back up that big claim with more big claims. I'll paraphrase the [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org) {Slide - Rust site} site; 

"Rust is blazingly fast with no runtime or garbage collector and it guarantees memory and thread safety". 

{Slide - Sweet jesus}{Pause}

They aren't kidding either, Rust stands up to every word and then some.

Have you ever been staring down a C++ bug, talking to your {Slide - Ducks} 8 rubber ducks as if they're your therapist, and just all around having an existential crisis? {Pause} I'm sure we've all known an equivalent feeling while programming.

Well the way rust works means you to never have to deal with _that_ kind of problem again. {Slide - Compiler complains} The compiler literally will not let you make mistakes like that.

Granted this comes with a few caveats {Slide - Faster Compiler} like the compiler being a bit slow. Or the few other things {Slide - Chaplin} you'll have to deal with in place of your own ignorance.

But if you ask me, and probably all the people who voted {Slide - StackOverflow} Rust as the #1 loved language every year since 2016 on the Stack Overflow survey, that is a small price to pay.

Essentially Rust takes C++, removes all the outdated crap, slaps on some sexy syntax and boom. Your favourite parts of CPP and Haskell all together in one place.

I'll finish up with a code comparison {Slide - Code}
